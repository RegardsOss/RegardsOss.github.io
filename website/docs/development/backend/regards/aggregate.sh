## How to access API endpoints

You can access each endpoint of this API thanks to a `Curl` request.

You can request without auhentication by adding the REGARDS project in the request thanks to the parameter `scope`
```bash
curl http://localhost:<rs-storage port>/<endpoint>?scope=<project>
```
Or you can authenticate to access admin endpoints. To do so, use the [authentication API](/development/regards/authentication/api/authentication-api/) to get a token and then add the token to the request headers.

```bash
curl http://localhost:<rs-storage port>/<endpoint> -H 'Authorization: bearer <token>'
```

To access endpoints from `outside` the microservice installation server, you need to use the "gateway" microservice. To do so, use the here under access point instead of the previous one.

```bash
curl http://<gateway host>:<gateway port>/rs-storage/api/v1/<endpoint>
```
