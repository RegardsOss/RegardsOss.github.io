The storybook provides a simple way to:

- visualize different states of your UI components faster and easier
- isolate React components from the real frontend
- build a static version of useable components that does not require a running backend

# Definition of Done

A DoD is a clear and concise list of requirements for the team to call a task complete.

For storybooks, we need to:

- let the user change the Theme (light theme and the dark theme) and the (i18n) language to English and French
- provides unit components - just a piece of news for example
- composition containers - to show the global layout
- Let the user edits props

# Install

Follow frontend dev installation.

Why using lorem lipsum content instead of real content ?

```
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
