## 1. Introduction

### 1. Purpose of the document

This document, Software Reuse File (SRF), describes any item of software, which it proposes for reuse.

It explains the reason why the software is proposed for reuse, where and the extent to which the software would be integrated in the software deliverables, the ownership of the software item and the license conditions on which the software could be used by the CNES or a third party during the contract, and after the contract's conclusion.

### 2. Scope

The document describes the software to be re-used in the frontend application during the pre-development phase (proof-of-concepts phase) of REGARDS.

For the sake of simplicity, only the most significant COTS will be described here.

### 3. Document structure

The document is structured as follows:

- This chapter gives the purpose and the structure of the document and the list of references: applicable and reference documents and definitions.
- Chapter 2 provides in a first part a detailed depiction of the free licenses categorization and impacts on users, and in a second part an analysis of the 3rd party products reused in REGARDS.

## 2. Third party products and required software licenses

This chapter provides an analysis of the 3rd party products reused in the REGARDS.

This chapter also identifies required Software Licenses, and lists all the development and documentation production tools.

However, before describing these elements, we introduce a reminder on free license products, in order to categorise the impact on any actor and other third party use during and after the project.

### 1. General

#### 1. Free license categorization and meaning

Free license are generally classified into the following three main categories, according to ascending permissivity:

- Strong copyleft licenses (GPL, CeCILL)
- Weak copyleft licenses (LGPL)
- Permissive licenses (BSD, MIT, Apache

All these licenses categories share some general features. They all **allow free use regardless of domain or country. They all allow redistribution. They all allow modification. They all allow distribution of the modifications** (these are known as the four freedoms of free software). The categories differ in how redistributed code can be licensed if someone decides to exercise his right to redistribute.

**Strong copyleft** licenses like GPL or CeCILL mandates that derived products are redistributed under the same terms as the original FOSS component that is used to build the product. This means that an image processing filter built using a CeCILL licensed library will also be subject to the same CeCILL license. This characteristic of the strong copyleft licenses is sometimes known as a "reciprocal" property: if one uses code from someone under a copyleft license for building a product, one will also distribute this product under the same license so other people can also build something else on top of it.

**Weak copyleft** licenses like LGPL, EPL or CeCILL-C are similar in spirit but the license spreading feature can be limited to modification of the original code. As an example, if an image processing filter uses an LGPL based library and is linked to it using dynamic linking only, then only the changes to the library must be distributed under the terms of the LGPL and the complete program can be distributed under other license terms if desired. So the "weak" term refers to the fact license reciprocity is more limited.

**Permissive licenses** like MIT, BSD or Apache licenses do not mandate any licensing terms for derived product. This means an image processing filter built using an Apache license library can be distributed under any licenses terms, even if the original Apache code itself has been modified.

As seen, copyleft notion has to deal with distribution agreement. It is better identified as a "reciprocal" effect but may sometimes be negatively referred to as "viral propagation", "infection" or "contamination" in some cases. For instance, let's consider a project which includes any amount of source code from free licensed product "A" and there is a need to make changes to some part of source code, corresponding to additional code "A' ", on the one hand, plus a need to add a wrapping layer "B", on the other hand. "A" + "A' " + "B" aiming to create a new "Alpha" application. "Alpha" product diffusion license can be chosen only according to "A" original license itself as explained hereafter:

- whenever "A" is distributed under the terms of a **strong** copyleft license, the entire new or modified pieces of code ("A' " in this example) or derived work ("B") becomes subject to the terms of the original license,
- Whenever "A" is distributed under the terms of a **weak** copyleft license, in some cases only modified work becomes subject to the terms of the original license. Thus, whereas "A" and "A' " will be subject to the terms of "A" original license, yet "B" may be submitted to another kind of license. Some conditions must be fulfilled in such a case: if both "A" and "A' " are part of a **dynamically linked** library and the final user is given the capability of replacing "A+A' " in order to introduce his own modification ""A+A'+A'' ", then "B" may be distributed under a different license. On the other side, if both "A" and "A' " are part of a **statically linked** library, then "B" should be distributed under the terms of the same license. Exact conditions of distribution are described within the license terms themselves. A careful attention must be paid onto the distribution license version, either LGPL v2.1 or LGPL v3, which differ on this point
- whenever "A" is distributed under the terms of a **permissive** license, then "A' " and "B" may be distributed under any kind of license, in fact, even "A" can be relicensed if needed

Distribution licenses type depends on two major characteristics.

First, the kind of distribution of a given license is conditioned by the intention or not to have it distributed to third parties or not. Thus, whenever developers use a given product, even modified, for private usage (private may be understood even within a firm), the derived product may be kept private and secret and need no specific license itself. However, whenever it is intended to distribute the product to third parties, then either updated or derived products should be distributed under free licenses as well.

Moreover, whenever one intends to distribute pieces of code under the terms of a copyleft license, then this distribution may be strictly limited to the product recipient alone. It is not mandatory to publish it on internet or to deliver it back to the original product former authors or community. Yet exception may be found in some cases (see later).

#### 2. Impact of free licenses on customers

Customers may be led to change their distribution policy for some products originally developed for their own internal use with no initial intention to have them shared or edited. Whenever they decide later on to have these products finally distributed to other space agencies for instance or industrial, they have to reconsider the licensing terms of the included free software components.

In order to make this kind of distribution policy changes possible, one way is to avoid using **strong** copyleft components even for internal products. This prevents expensive developments to get rid of some restrictive COTS for instance and replace them by more permissive equivalent.

Therefore, CS proposes, when possible, to avoid **strong** copyleft COTS usage within its developments, such as GPL, AGPL, CeCILL and prefer **weak** copyleft (res. **permissive** license) such as LGPL, CeCILL-C (res. CeCILL-B, BSD, MIT, Apache).

Using **weak** copyleft licenses products without any change enables to guarantee that no code developed within the project should fall under distribution rules that may get incompatible to related intellectual property laws.

Vulnerability CVE identifier | Description | CVSS Score | Publication date | Solved By  
:--------------------------: | :---------: | :--------: | :--------------: | :-------:  
CVE-2018-1272 | Spring Framework versions 5.0 to 5.0.4, 4.3 to 4.3.14, and older unsupported versions provide client-side support for multipart requests. When Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux server application (server A) receives input from a remote client, and then uses that input to make a multipart request to another server (server B), it can be exposed to an attack, where an extra multipart is inserted in the content of the request from server A, causing server B to use the wrong value for a part it expects. This could to lead privilege escalation, for example, if the part content represents a username or user roles. | 0.0 | 2018-04-06 | 4.3.15+/5.0.5+  

In order for the attacker to succeed, they would have to be able to guess the multipart boundary value chosen by server A for the multipart request to server B, which requires the attacker to also have control of the server or the ability to see the HTTP log of server A through a separate attack vector.

CVE-2018-1271 |  Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, allow applications to configure Spring MVC to serve static resources (e.g. CSS, JS, images). When static resources are served from a file system on Windows (as opposed to the classpath, or the ServletContext), a malicious user can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead a directory traversal attack. | 0.0 | 2018-04-06 | 4.3.15+/5.0.5+  

This vulnerability exposes REGARDS to no threats as we are not serving static resources from the file system.

CVE-2018-1270 | Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, allow applications to expose STOMP over WebSocket endpoints with a simple, in-memory STOMP broker through the spring-messaging module. A malicious user (or attacker) can craft a message to the broker that can lead to a remote code execution attack. | 0.0 | 2018-04-06 | 4.3.15+/5.0.5+  
CVE-2018-1275 | Partial fix for CVE-2018-1270 | 0.0 | 2018-04-11 | 4.3.16/5.0.5+  

This vulnerability exposes REGARDS to no threats as we are not using the spring-messaging module and we are not using WebSockets either.

CVE-2018-1199 | Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with special encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification (see below). Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. In this particular attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed. | 5.0 | 2018-01-29 | 4.13.14+/5.0.3+
