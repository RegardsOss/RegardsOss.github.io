**NOTE:** The following are changes specific to CircleCI Enterprise. For general changes to CircleCI see our [public Changelog](https://circleci.com/changelog/).

### 2016-08-12: Release 1.45.1:
* Fix for an issue that was causing builds to fail that were triggered by users with a github account but no circleci account.
Note: we are shifting our versioning to better reflect the current release semantically.

### 2016-08-11: Release 0.2.45
* PR-only builds - We have added functionality to only run builds when a pull request is open. To enable this functionality you can navigate to “Advanced Settings” for your project and enable the “Only build pull requests” option.
* Chrome notifications - see [the docs](https://circleci.com/docs/web-notifications/)
* Fixed a bug where builds triggered by people who don't have seats in CircleCI Enterprise were not running. They now should run as before.
* Some UI changes to make updating data in the web interface more consistent.
* Reliability improvements by changing retry logic in various places.

### 2016-07-26: Release 0.2.44

Bug fix: We've fixed a bug that "--branch" option was missing when "--single-branch" is used.

### 2016-07-26: Release 0.2.43

New Feature: The maximum size of files that you can upload for caching during builds has been fixed to 5G. The size is now bumped 20G by default on CircleCI Enterprise and customers can also override the default value to even larger size.

To override the default value, you need to run the following in a REPL of Service Box.

```
(settings/set {:max-file-cache-bytes <max-size-by-bytes>})
```

To unset the overridden value and use default, run the following.

```
(settings/unset! [:max-file-cache-bytes])
```

### 2016-07-14: Release 0.2.42

New Feature: Custom base URL for version control webhooks. When a new project is added, CircleCI will add a webhook to the GitHub repository of the project. With this new feature, you can override the default webhook base URL from the System Settings page under the Admin tools (available to designated administrative users). This feature is useful when your instance is behind firewall or other proxy and cannot directly receive webhooks from GitHub.

### 2016-07-7: Release 0.2.41

This release fixes a bug in the URL structure used to serve build artifacts.

The artifact URL format was recently changed to handle security concerns related to CircleCI's hosted offering. The security concerns do not affect CircleCI Enterprise customers, but the change caused issues fetching build artifacts in CircleCI Enterprise installations. This release reverts the CircleCI Enterprise artifact format and resolves the issue.

### 2016-07-01: Builder AMI updates

We've updated the builder AMIs to include fixes for CVE-2016-4997 and CVE-2016-4998.

You can always see the newest recommended AMIs [on the AWS installation page]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/aws-manual/#builder).

### 2016-06-30: Release 0.2.38
* **Please Note:** If you are using OS X builds you will need to run a manual migration as part of this release. After upgrading you will need to run this in a REPL: `(circle.backend.model.esxi-vm/run-migrations!)`. Please talk with your account manager if you need further instructions.
* The Admin Users page now has links to the builds of each user.
* The API has a new endpoint `/api/v1/admin/licensing` that returns information about the number of seats available, number being used, when the license will expire, and how many inactive users there are in the system.
* Fixed a bug where links to the documentation broke.
* Various small bug fixes and UI improvements.

### 2016-05-12: Release 0.2.36
<!-- Built with https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circle/141556 -->
<!-- Based on https://github.com/circleci/circle/commit/3ae5f47c15561373135881b314d5ccbada6e10a2 -->

Please make sure that you are using the latest
`provision-builder.sh` and `init-builder-0.2.sh` before you upgrade to this release:

<https://s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-enterprise/provision-builder.sh>

<https://s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-enterprise/init-builder-0.2.sh>

As part of this release we're changing the behavior of artifacts to
only serve a whitelisted set of content-types. This means we won't
serve .html files as text/html. This is a security risk on CircleCI
Enterprise since artifacts are served on the same domain as the rest
of the site -- as a result, any user or malicious code used as part of
your build can push a specially-crafted artifact and gain control of
another user's account.

If this is an issue, you can override this behavior by setting
"Serve artifacts with unsafe content-types" in the admin console. We don't
recommend this, but we're providing it for backwards compatibility.

This release also includes some changes to container
networking. Containers now each use a /24 in the subnet 172.16.1.0/16
by default.

If this conflicts with your private network, or if you were editing lxc-net
manually in order to fix a prior conflict, you can now use
`CIRCLE_CONTAINERS_SUBNET` and `CIRCLE_CONTAINERS_SUBNET_NETMASK_LENGTH`
on the builders to configure those. See "Adjusting Builder Networking" in the
[configuration section]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/config/).

### 2016-03-04: Release 0.2.26
<!-- Built with https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circle/138331 -->
<!-- Based on https://github.com/circleci/circle/commit/7c507867b44ae0a5f14f7a27ed03e591dcb79f81 -->

* permit node-to-node ssh feature
* show number of licensed and active users
* faster test results processing
* disallow all bots in /robots.txt by default

Published a new build container images with glibc vulnerability fix.  The new precise image will be activated by default by 2016-03-11.  You can activate it earlier, or test it, by specifying the image id in builder launch configuration:

```
curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/circleci-enterprise/init-builder-0.2.sh | \
    CIRCLE_CONTAINER_IMAGE_ID=circleci-precise-container_0.0.1551 \
    SERVICES_PRIVATE_IP=<private ip address of services box> \
    CIRCLE_SECRET_PASSPHRASE=<passphrase entered on system console (services box port 8800) settings> \
    bash
```

Also, published a new trusty image with container id: `circleci-trusty-container_0.0.312`.

### 2016-03-01: Release 0.2.25
<!-- Built with https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circle/137950 -->
<!-- Based on https://github.com/circleci/circle/commit/226d5671809c6c20ae95fceaf4dfd91fab4b48d1 -->

* add an option to clear source caching on a project
* reuse ports 80/443 for websockets.  You may remove port 8081 rule from security groups

### 2016-02-17: Release 0.2.24
<!-- Built with https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circle/135539 -->
<!-- Based on https://github.com/circleci/circle/commit/c4951ff964b27da30104220c8ae7d54c3962952d -->

Patched glibc security vulnerability.
Please also make sure you patch the following places:
1. Run `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libc6` on your Services box, and restart.
2. Update the AMI for your builder machine. Our AWS install doc contains the latest AMI image ids, as well as updated terraform / cloudformation templates: <{{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/aws/>
3. If you are using a custom container image, you will also want to update that.

* New look and feel for the UI
* Switching to privileged LXC by default, paving the way for you to use the latest version of vanilla Docker instead of the fork we use on circleci.com.
