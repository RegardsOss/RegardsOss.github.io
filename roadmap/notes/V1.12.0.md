Planned features:

- New microservice `Long Term Archive (LTA)` to provide a simplified and high level REST & AMQP API to submit products into the OAIS catalog.
- OAIS system will be able to download files associated to products during ingestion from a list of configured S3 servers. 

We'll try to address as many production tickets as possible!
