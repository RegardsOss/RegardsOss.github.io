- Storage can now access files stored on S3 servers during the OAIS ingestion. 
- An improved admin experience with a new search panel that replaces all search fields above the data table on many views (OAIS, GeoJSON catalog, users...)
- Unify search payload expected by many administrators microservices REST API to be usable by the admin HMI (Breaking change)
- Allow to deploy REGARDS with an external ElasticSearch or RabbitMQ service
- Ingest can now valide OAIS product against a model during ingestion.
- The Worker Manager can process a request using several workers that creates a chain of workers (1-1). 
- Improve the boot system from REGARDS microservices to make microservices waits each other on boot (Kubernetes friendly)
- Open on Order a new REST API (or AMQP) to easily create orders and download available files, designed to be used by external software
