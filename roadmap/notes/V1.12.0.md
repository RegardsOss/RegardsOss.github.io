**Operational version**

Planned features:

- New microservice `Long Term Archive (LTA)` to provide a simplified and high level REST & AMQP API to submit products into the OAIS catalog.
- Storage can now access files stored on S3 servers during the OAIS ingestion
- An improved admin experience with a new search panel that replaces all search fields above the data table on many views (OAIS, GeoJSON catalog, users...)
- Unify search payload REST API to be usable by HMI administrators (Breaking change)
- Enable REGARDS deployment with an external ElasticSearch or RabbitMQ service
- Ingest microservice can now valide OAIS product against a model during ingestion
- Worker Manager microservice can process a request using several workers to create a chain of workers (1-1) 
- Improve booting system to make microservices wait for each other (Kubernetes friendly)
- Add a new order REST API (or AMQP) to easily create orders and download available files, designed to be used by external software
- Users can now filter by file types and file names on ordered products
- Enhance RabbitMQ security by using SSL communication (regards-oss-docker)

We'll try to address as many production tickets as possible!
