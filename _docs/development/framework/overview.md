## Technology stack

REGARDS framework is built on top of [Spring projects](https://spring.io/):

At the moment, the framework relies on:
  * OpenJDK 8
  * [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#learn) `1.5.X.RELEASE`
  * [Spring Cloud](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud#learn) `Dalston SR5`

> Note that we are upgrading COTS to OpenJDK 11, Spring Boot 2+, etc. (cf. [Roadmap](/home/roadmap/#v400))
