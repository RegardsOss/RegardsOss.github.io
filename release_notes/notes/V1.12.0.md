- Enable REGARDS deployment with an external ElasticSearch or RabbitMQ service
- Ingest microservice can now valide OAIS product against a model during ingestion
- Worker Manager microservice can process a request using several workers to create a chain of workers (1-1) 
- Improve booting system to make microservices wait for each other (Kubernetes friendly)

- Users can now filter by file types and file names on ordered products

## Breaking change

### REST API

The here-under endpoints used by administrators **have important breaking changes**.  

 - Microservice rs-access-project
    - We've replaced the endpoint `/users (verb: GET)` into `/users/search (verb: POST)` and search criteria. [Click here to see new api documentation](/docs/development/backend/services/access-project/api-swagger#tag/project-users-controller/operation/retrieveProjectUserList). 
 - Microservice rs-ingest
    - Modifying search criteria on endpoint `/aips (verb: POST)`. [Click here to see new api documentation](/docs/development/backend/services/ingest/api-swagger#tag/aip-controller/operation/searchAIPs). 
    - Modifying search criteria on endpoint `/requests (verb: POST)`. [Click here to see new api documentation](/docs/development/backend/services/ingest/api-swagger#tag/request-controller/operation/searchRequest). 
 - Microservice rs-fem
    - Modifying `/admin/features` from verb `GET` into `POST` and search criteria. [Click here to see new api documentation](/docs/development/backend/services/fem/api-swagger#tag/feature-entity-controller/operation/searchFeatures). 
    - We've replaced the endpoint `/requests/search (verb: GET)` into `/requests/search/{type} (verb: POST)` and search criteria. [Click here to see new api documentation](/docs/development/backend/services/fem/api-swagger#tag/feature-request-controller/operation/searchFeatureRequests). 
 - Microservice rs-processing
    - We've replaced the endpoint `/monitoring/executions (verb: GET)` into `/monitoring/executions (verb: POST)` and search criteria. [Click here to see new api documentation](/docs/development/backend/services/processing/api-swagger#tag/p-monitoring-controller/operation/executions). 

:::info Why these REST API breaking changes?
The new powerful search engine provided by the admin HMI made some impacts on these endpoints.  
For example, users can now filter `Provider ID` against a list of string values...

### AMQP API

There is two exchanges used by the Worker Manager microservice that have **a breaking change on their name**.

The exchange was:  
`regards.broadcast.fr.cnes.regards.modules.workermanager.dto.events.in.RequestEvent`  
And is now:  
`regards.broadcast.fr.cnes.regards.modules.workermanager.amqp.events.in.RequestEvent`

The exchange was:  
`regards.broadcast.fr.cnes.regards.modules.workermanager.dto.events.out.ResponseEvent`  
And is now:  
`regards.broadcast.fr.cnes.regards.modules.workermanager.amqp.events.out.ResponseEvent`
