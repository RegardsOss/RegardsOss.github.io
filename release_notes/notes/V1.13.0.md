## Breaking change

### Deployment

- You need to follow the Ansible migration guide to update your playbook from V1.12 to V1.13
- You should active the `securised: true` on the frontend service. See the impact below.
```yaml
group_docker_mservices:
  [...]
  front:
    [...]
    securised: true
```



### API changes :

**All microservices**

:::danger Header parameter`Host` may be required

The reverse proxy NGinx now refuses requests if there are not hitting the public domain name of your REGARDS instance.  

If you use the public domain name of your REGARDS instance, there is no change to do:
```bash 
$ curl -k 'https://regards.host.com/api/v1/rs-admin-instance/projects?page=0&size=100'
-- it's working
```

If you use some Swarm node hostname, the request will be refused:
```bash
$ curl -k 'https://regards-node01/api/v1/rs-admin-instance/projects?page=0&size=100'
<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx</center>
</body>
</html>
```

To make it work, you need to add the `Host` header parameter with the public domain name of your REGARDS instance:
```bash
$ curl -k 'https://regards-node01/api/v1/rs-admin-instance/projects?page=0&size=100' \
  -H 'Host: the-server-name.host.com' \
-- it's working
```
