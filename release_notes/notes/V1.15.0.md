## Features

### OAIS Catalog notifications and dissemination

REGARDS now provides, on the OAIS Catalog, the ability to disseminate products to Notifier, as FEM catalog can already
do.  
To do so, admins can select a list of AIPs using search criteria, click on the button `Disseminate product`, select
a list of recipients to send the product to, or let Notifier rules decides where the product should be sent.  
Dissemination requests can be monitored on the OAIS requests dashboard and on the main Dashboard.  
AIP metadata tracks when and where the AIP have been disseminated, and if an acknowledgment is expected and have been
received.

### Data access without Ordering on Nearline storage locations

If your Nearline storage location provides a cache of files on tape, you can now download these files without asking
REGARDS to put these files into its internal cache.  
It allows to download these files threw the catalog REST API directly, with no order made.  
To do so, we now provide:

* An endpoint to [check if nearline product files](/docs/development/backend/services/catalog/api-guides/rest/file-restoration-api#check-product-availability-endpoint) 
  are immediately downloadable
* An endpoint to [makes nearline product files available](/docs/development/backend/services/catalog/api-guides/rest/file-restoration-api#product-restoration-endpoint) to download
* An exchange to [be notified when a nearline file is now available](/docs/development/backend/services/storage/file-availability-api)

### Web interface (HMI)

In this new release, we've improved:

* The notification interface has been remade to make it more intuitive and allow research among received notifications.
* On the user app side, users can now save their research to re-use it later.

## Breaking change

### Deployment

You need to follow the [Ansible migration guide to update your playbook from V1.14 to V1.15](/docs/setup/swarm/migration/1.14-to-1.15)

### REST API

- **Notification API** on **Microservice RS-ADMIN** and **Microservice RS-ADMIN-INSTANCE**
    - endpoint`/notifications`: replace the `GET` endpoint by a `POST` endpoint to allow complex
      criteria. [see admin api doc](/docs/development/backend/services/admin/api-swagger#tag/notification-controller/operation/retrieveNotifications)
      and [see admin instance api doc](/docs/development/backend/services/admin-instance/api-swagger#tag/notification-controller/operation/retrieveNotifications)
    - remove endpoint to mark all notification read `notifications/all/read`
    - remove endpoint to mark all notification unread `notifications/all/unread`
- **Microservice RS-STORAGE**
  - all queues and exchanges used by Storage to consume and produce messages have been migrated to another package
- **Microservice RS-FEM**
    - criteria `disseminationPending` (type bool) replaced by new criteria `disseminationStatus` (enum with
      values `NONE`, `PENDING` or `DONE`) on
        - [endpoint search fem product](/docs/development/backend/services/fem/guides/rest/api#tag/feature-entity-controller/operation/searchFeatures)
        - [endpoint delete fem product](/docs/development/backend/services/fem/guides/rest/api#tag/feature-entity-controller/operation/deleteFeatures_1)
        - [endpoint notify fem product](/docs/development/backend/services/fem/guides/rest/api#tag/feature-entity-controller/operation/notifyFeatures)
- **Microservice RS-DAM**
    - Add new attribute type `INTEGER_RANGE`, `DOUBLE_RANGE`, `DATE_RANGE` and `LONG_RANGE`.  
      You should try to replace your `INTEGER_INTERVAL`, `DOUBLE_INTERVAL`, `DATE_INTERVAL` and `LONG_INTERVAL`
      attributes by these new attributes as their implementation are natives to ElasticSearch (faster research).  
      `INTEGER_INTERVAL`, `DOUBLE_INTERVAL`, `DATE_INTERVAL` and `LONG_INTERVAL` attributes will be deprecated on 1.16.0
      and their support dropped soon after.  
      [see api doc](/docs/development/backend/services/dam/api-swagger#tag/attribute-model-controller/operation/getAttributes)

## Bug fixes

- Fix file name received when downloading a file, as the filename was the shared with another file with same checksum
- When download file with the DownloadPlugin on user app, close the popup instead of showing an error
- Add `JobEventHandler` on Notifier service
- Fix an issue on DAM microservice that prevents the service to boot with invalid configuration
- Improve validation to prevent creation of invalid attribute JsonSchema
- Improve Docker Java images as Garbage collector configuration was invalid which leads to bad Heap Size control and OOM
