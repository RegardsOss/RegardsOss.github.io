## Features

### Model importation

It is now possible to modify a data model by importing it in XML format. Previously, only creation was possible via import.
Modifying a data model by importing an XML file is restricted to adding a new **optional** attribute to the model.
Any other differences between the current model and the imported one will be ignored.

Importing a data model via an XML file is documented [here](https://regardsoss.github.io/docs/user-guide/data-organization/models).


### Dissemination ack sender plugin

A new optional attribute has been added to the DisseminationAckSender propertyPathToUrn plugin.

This new optional parameter defines the path to the attribute defining the URN of the original product in the acknowledged feature.

The URN of the original product corresponds to the URN of the product in the catalog that we are distributing the product to and that is waiting for an acknowledgement. The URN in the current catalog is different.

This original URN is used to find out which product to acknowledge in the original catalog that distributed the product.

By default, the plugin searches the feature's “originUrn” field.

### New downloader microservice

Due to scalability problems with REGARDS' rs-storage service, the direct download functionality for files associated with catalog products has been removed from this service.

This download functionality has been delegated to the new rs-downloader microservice.

By default, REGARDS uses this new service if it is installed. Otherwise, downloading is still handled by the “rs-storage” service.

This new service doesn't add any new functionality, but its scalability means it can be used for a large number of parallel downloads. Each instance is designed (by default) to handle 100 parallel downloads.

### Admin GUI improvment

Add informative text to product search filters and GeoJson queries to explain the impact of different filter criteria.

## Bug fixes

- deployment
 - The services' actuator port has been moved to a dedicated port (8081) to prevent healthCheck from not responding when the service is overloaded (its Jetty connection pool is full).

- rs-admin:
 - Fixed a bug that allowed two user accounts to be created with the same e-mail address if the case was different.

- rs-storage
  - Download scalability problem.
  - Threshold too low for using a temporary file when storing files online from an S3 storage space. 
  - Corrected a performance problem on file availability requests on an S3 server when many downloads are performed in parallel.
  - Fixed a bug that invalidated the calculation of users' download quotas when many downloads were performed in parallel.

- rs-dam
 - Fixed a problem with the calculation of access rights when using the [CustomDataObjectsAccessPlugin](https://regardsoss.github.io/docs/development/services/dam/plugins/overview#access-rights-plugins).
 - Fixed a bug in dataset modification that forced the calculation of access rights and associated objects for each modification. This calculation should only be performed if necessary.
 - Fixed a bug that caused the same request to modify the rights of a dataset to be processed ad infinitum if the processing of the request took longer than the RabbitMQ message acknowledgement timeout.

- rs-order
 - Fixed a database transaction management problem that prevented several commands from being run simultaneously
 - Added a sub-command download restriction to prevent the same download from being run several times.

- rs-lta-manager
 - Fixed a bug in the service that caused the AMQP denied response not to be sent in the event of a request deserialization error.

- rs-fem
  - Corrected a bug in the service that rendered the AMQP endpoint for requesting [product acknowledgement](https://regardsoss.github.io/docs/development/backend/services/fem/guides/amqp/publish-acknowledge-request) unusable.
   - Correction of a bug that duplicated the product distribution information to the same recipient.

- GUI 
 - Added missing translation of INACTIVE_PASSWORD status in user consultation screen.
