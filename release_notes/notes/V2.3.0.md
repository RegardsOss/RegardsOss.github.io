## Features

### Improved Naming and Layout of Delivery Files

The name and structure of the zip files generated by the delivery service have evolved. The new naming conventions
are described [in the documentation](../docs/next/user-guide/order-data/settings-delivery#format-de-livraison).

### Indexation improvement

Elastic entities insertions are now asynchronous. It is now recommended to increase the size of the Elasticsearch connection pool to handle the higher level of parallelism. See the [configuration guide](../docs/next/development/services/dam/configuration/static-configuration#ansible-editable-properties) for details on how to configure this value (regards.jpa.multitenant.maxPoolSize).
