## New product workflow

REGARDS introduces a new worker system to handle complex pre-processing and post-processing product workflow.  
Some modification on admin dashboard helps operators to get the overview of this hightly-configurable workflow.

## New deployment

Our Ansible playbook has been improved to support more production usecases: 
 - You can now run ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ in cluster mode
 - Swarm managers can be run as manager-only
 - Most of REGARDS microservices can now be replicated and placed on specific swarm node using Swarm labels

## Others improvements & bugfix

- STAC protocol improvements
- Improve CI/CD
- Few production tickets closed
