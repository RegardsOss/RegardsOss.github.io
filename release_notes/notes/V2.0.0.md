### Auto retry amqp message failure

The Regards AMQP starter framework is improved to :

- Allow retry for AMQP message batch when an unexpected error occurred.
- Invalid format message (deserialization issues) are not sent to DLQ anymore. Those messages are not valid, it is not
  useful to keep them.

Retry system is based on RabbitMQ
plugin [rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange)

:::info
If you do not use the RabbitMQ server provided by the REGARDS RabbitMQ image, ensure
the `rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange` is active
:::

Starting with this version, auto retry is activated for some AMQP queues.
Retry is enabled on:

- `rs-fem` microservice - creation/deletion/dissemination/update/notification requests queues.
- `rs-notifier` microservice - notification requests queues.

Auto retry configuration (number of retries and delay before retries) is done with new inventory properties :

- rs-fem : `group_docker_mservices.fem.configuration.retry_delay_attempts`
- rs-notifier : `group_docker_mservices.notifier.configuration.retry_delay_attempts`

### Create basket using text file

You can now fill a basket by uploading a text file containing provider ID on Order microservice.  
See [Fill basket from file](/docs/development/backend/services/order/guides/fill-basket-from-file) guide for
further information.

### Add filters to order files

Before placing an order you have the possibility to add selection criteria to the files of your order.
See [File filters](/docs/user-guide/order-data/file-filters) for further information.

## Deprecation

### Authentication

Authentication endpoint `/oauth/token` will not accept `url query parameters` in further versions.
New way to retrieve an authentication token is to use body parameters of the `POST` request instead.

:::danger Password issue
When you send an authentification request to REGARDS, `url query parameters` may be saved on the reverse
proxy with username and **password**! With `POST` body parameters, the reverse proxy won't log these sensitive
information.
:::

## Breaking change

### Deployment

You need to follow
the [Ansible migration guide to update your playbook from V1.15 to V2.0](/docs/setup/swarm/migration/1.15-to-2.0)

### REST API

No breaking changes.

### Plugins

#### Notifier plugin : Dissemination ACK Sender

The `Dissemination-ack-sender-plugin` can now handle dissemination ack from both OAIS and GeoJson catalogs.
To do so, the plugin configuration is modified from the previous version. You have to follow
the [plugin configuration migration guide](/docs/setup/swarm/migration/1.15-to-2.0).
