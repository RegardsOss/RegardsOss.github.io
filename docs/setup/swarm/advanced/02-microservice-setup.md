## Update inventory with microservices you need

:::info
The next section will describe all REGARDS microservices and how to enable them.
:::

### Disable/enable a REGARDS microservice

If you look at your inventory file `regards-cnes/group_vars/regards_nodes/main.yml`, you may see that many microservices
are commented.

```yml
# Stack
group_docker_mservices:
  access_project:
    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  #  notifier:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  #  fem:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  #  storage:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  #  order:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  #  ingest:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  #  dataprovider:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  #  processing:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  #  worker_manager:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  front:
    protocol: http
```

If you uncomment a microservice, like so:

```yml
# Stack
group_docker_mservices:
  #  fem:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  storage:
    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
  #  order:
  #    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
```

It means to the playbook that the microservice storage will be activated on the next deployment.

### Plugins

There is a section in your inventory that lists all plugins that will be available for
microservices: `group_docker_plugins`.

If you want to add [the `aip-datasource` plugin](../../../development/services/dam/plugins/overview.md) to allow the
microservice DataManagement to crawl OAIS products, you need to add the image plugin in the `group_docker_plugins`
property:

```yml
# Plugins
group_docker_plugins:
  - image: rs-aip-datasource-plugin
    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.plugins }}"
```

:::info

The documentation of every microservice list all OSS plugins and their image name.  
Here is some examples:

- [rs-dam or DataManagement plugins](../../../development/services/dam/plugins/overview.md)
- [rs-notifier plugins](../../../development/services/notifier/plugins/overview.md)
- [rs-ingest plugins](../../../development/services/ingest/plugins/overview.md)
- [rs-catalog plugins](../../../development/services/catalog/plugins/overview.md)
- ...

:::

### Internal catalogs

There is 3 types of crawler that lets REGARDS to populate its meta-catalog :

- the *internal* [OAIS catalog](../../../user-documentation/4_1-ingest/introduction-ingest.md)
- the *internal* [GeoJSON catalog](../../../user-documentation/4_3-fem/introduction-fem.md)
- or an *external* [datasource](../../../user-documentation/5-crawler/configure-datasource.md) (an OpenSearch Web
  source, an external Database....)

All types of crawlers can be active at the same time, but you may not need them on your instance at the same time.

:::info Activate microservice carrefully
If you activate only the microservices you need, the admin HMI will not show you the configuration and pages related to
everything you have desactivated !  
Activate them only if you need them.
:::

Here is the difference between these two internal catalogs:

Activate the Ingest microservice :

```yml
# Replace
#  ingest:
#    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
# By
ingest:
  tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
```

Activate the Feature Manager microservice :

```yml
# Replace
#  fem:
#    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
# By
fem:
  tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
```

:::info
If you want to crawl an external datasource, do not activate any of these internal catalogs.
:::

### Create Ingest product using DataProvider

The microservice DataProvider allows you to create your products
using [Data acquisition chains](../../../user-documentation/4_2-dataprovider/acquisition-chain-configuration.md). It
scans files on disk and creates SIP according to these files.  
Here are some core features of DataProvider :

- Regroup several files inside a product (SIP)
- Scan the folder periodically in order to create new product when they are available
- When necessary, product generation can be fully customized using dedicated plugin to extract metadata from the
  filename or the file content

Activate the DataProvider microservice :

```yml
# Replace
#  dataprovider:
#    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
# By
dataprovider:
  tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
```

This microservice requires : `Ingest`

### File management using Storage

The Storage microservice can store
on [different types of storage system](../../../user-documentation/2-project-configuration/storage-configuration.md):

- Online storages : local disk, NFS...
- Nearline storages : Tape Backup, S3 Glacier...

But it also manages *external* files that are already available through an existing REST HTTP(S) server.

|                                              |     File already available <br/>through existing REST HTTP(S) server     |                                                     File NOT available <br/>through existing REST HTTP(S) server                                                      |

|       Support nearline storage system        |                                    N                                     |                                                                                   Y                                                                                   |

Once a file is managed by the Storage microservice, its products can be ordered by users.

:::info
Any product coming from an internal catalog will use the Storage microservice to reference or store its files
:::

Activate the Storage microservice :

```yml
# Replace
#  storage:
#    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
# By
storage:
  tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
```

This microservice requires : `FEM` or `Ingest`

### Internal and external notification management

The microservice Notifier receives all FEM and Ingest products everytime they change.  
It allows you to emit a notification to any system with a very granular syntax to decide whenever a product must be sent
to some destination.  
The Notifier plugin system allows you to adapt the content of the notification sent to match your needs.

Activate the Notifier microservice :

```yml
# Replace
#  notifier:
#    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
# By
notifier:
  tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
```

This microservice requires : `FEM` or `Ingest`

### Workers manager

Workers manager is a powerful system designed to handle any type of task on your workflow.  
For example, you can raise a product notification using Notifier microservice to ask a worker to enhance the product.  
The worker can read the file and send an update request into the internal catalog.

As there is no Worker publicly available, you do not need to enable this service yet.

### Orders management

The microservice Order allows [users to make orders](../../../user-documentation/8-order-data/introduction-order.md).  
If this system is not active, orders are not available.

Activate the Order microservice :

```yml
# Replace
#  order:
#    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
# By
order:
  tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
```

This microservice requires : `Storage`

### Process orders

The microservice Processing allows you
to [process ordered datafiles](../../../user-documentation/8-order-data/processing.md).  
Once configured, the user can choose to activate a processing on its ordered data :

- Convert the project of a NetCDF file
- Crop a file
- Call external processing system
- ...

Activate the Processing microservice :

```yml
# Replace
#  processing:
#    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
# By
processing:
  tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.back }}"
```

This microservice requires : `Order`

## Run changes

Once you have edited your inventory, you must execute the following command to update the stack:

```bash
# cd regards-docker-master/
ansible-playbook -i inventories/<inventory name> regards.yml <additional parameters>
```

That's it!

### Full setup conclusion

Congratulations, your REGARDS installation is over.

Execute `./health.sh all` and wait all microservices are 200 :

```bash
