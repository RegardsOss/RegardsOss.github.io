Steps to migrate REGARDS from version 2.0 to 2.1

## Database modifications

In version 2.1 of REGARDS, it is no longer allowed to have multiple users with identical email addresses except for the case.
It is therefore necessary before the migration to check the uniqueness of the usernames by case-sensitive email address.

Here are some SQL queries to run on the admin schema of the rs-instance database to display the duplicate user accounts that will need to be removed for the migration to REGARDS 2.1.

```sql
SELECT LOWER(t_account.email), count(*) FROM "admin"."t_account" group by LOWER(t_account.email) HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT * FROM "admin"."t_account" WHERE LOWER(email) IN (SELECT LOWER(t_account.email) FROM "admin"."t_account" group by LOWER(t_account.email) HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) ORDER BY email;
```

In order for the REGARDS application to be migrated and started, the previous queries must return no results.
