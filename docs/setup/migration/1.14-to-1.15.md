Steps to migrate REGARDS from version 1.14 to 1.15

- Download last playbook version and move your inventory inside the new playbook
- Edit your inventory file `group_vars/all/main.yml` :

```yaml
# Replace 
version: 1.14.7
# Into 
version: 1.15.0
```

:::info
When this guide has been written, last version was 1.15.0. Check if there is an updated version
available [here](https://github.com/orgs/RegardsOss/packages/container/package/rs-authentication)
:::

- Remove deprecated property `docker_dns` inside your inventory file `group_vars/docker_nodes/main.yml`:

```yaml
#docker_dns:
#  - 8.8.8.8
```

- Inside your inventory file `group_vars/regards_nodes/main.yml`, remove deprecated properties:
    - all references to `enable_resource_limits` and `enable_resource_limits`
    - property `group_docker_use_log_concentrator`
    - property `group_docker_mservices.front.securised`

- If you declare a some memory limit override inside your inventory file `group_vars/regards_nodes/main.yml`, you need
  to write `2560m` instead of `2560mb` or `2g` instead of `2gb` (remove `b`)

- Inside your inventory file `group_vars/regards_nodes/main.yml`, add `group_docker_static_files_migrated` property:
```yaml
[...]
group_docker_registry: ghcr.io/regardsoss

# Files needs to be moved from ./files/ to ../../static/
# using $ mv ./files ../../static
group_docker_static_files_migrated: False

group_docker_tags:
[...]
```

- Shutdown REGARDS using the playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] regards-shutdown.yml [...]
```

- Disconnect swarm nodes
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] delete-swarm.yml [...]
```

- Reinstall swarm nodes
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] setup-vm.yml [...]
```
:::info
You must do the `setup-vm.yml` step whether you use the logging stack or not
:::

- Update REGARDS using the playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] regards.yml [...]
```
