Steps to migrate REGARDS from version 1.13 to 1.14

- Download last playbook version and move your inventory inside the new playbook
- Edit your inventory file `group_vars/all/main.yml` :
```yaml
# Replace 
  version: 1.13.1
# Into 
  version: 1.14.0
```

:::info
When this guide has been writen, last version was 1.14.0. Check if there is an updated version available [here](https://github.com/orgs/RegardsOss/packages/container/package/rs-authentication)
:::

- Add a property `group_docker_use_log_concentrator` inside your inventory file `group_vars/regards_nodes/main.yml`:

```yaml
[...]
group_docker_network_name: 'regards_{{ group_stack_name }}'
group_docker_network_ip_network: '10.11.7.'

group_docker_registry: ghcr.io/regardsoss

# Add here-under new property
group_docker_use_log_concentrator: True

[...]
```
:::info
This property means that you have re-install swarm (you will run `ansible-playbook -i [...] setup-vm.yml [...]` at the end of this guide) and now, the log configuration is managed by Docker and not described on services when deployed.
:::

- Ensure properties `enable_resource_limits`, inside your inventory file `group_vars/regards_nodes/main.yml`, exists and equals to `true`

```yaml
group_docker_cots_configuration:
  enable_healthcheck: true

group_config_mservices:
  enable_healthcheck: true
```
:::danger Resource limits are now mandatory!
If you don't provide any resource limit to REGARDS containers, they won't have any memory limit. Before 1.14, they were limited to some amount of memory, but now they use containers limits.  
See [Breaking Changes section](#breaking-change) to get more info about this change
:::


- Remove deprecated logging services `elasticsearch_logs`, `kibana_logs`, and `fluent` from your stack:

```yaml
# Before
group_docker_cots:
  [..]
  elasticsearch_logs:
    [..]
  kibana_logs:
    [..]
  fluent:
    [..]

# After
# Everything related these components is removed
group_docker_cots:
  [..]
```
- Remove `group_docker_cots_configuration.elasticsearch_logs` as you don't use the `elasticsearch_logs` service anymore

- *Optional:* Follow the [logging stack guide to add Grafana, Loki, Prometheus and many other services](../advanced/swarm-logging-stack.md) to get started with the new powerful logging and monitoring stack

- *Optional:* Add following properties inside your inventory file `group_vars/docker_nodes/main.yml`, at the end of the file:

```yaml
yum_proxy: "{{ global_proxy.url | default(None) }}"
python_version: 3
[...] # add to the end of the file:

# Logging Driver
log_driver_type: fluentd
log_driver_opts:
  fluentd-address : 127.0.0.1:24224
  fluentd-async : "true"
  fluentd-retry-wait : 15s
  cache-max-size: 10m
  cache-max-file: 10
```
:::info
Do this step only if you want to use the logging stack. The default value of `log_driver_type` is `json-file`
:::

- Shutdown REGARDS using the playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] regards-shutdown.yml [...]
```

- Deconnects swarm nodes
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] delete-swarm.yml [...]
```

- Reinstall swarm nodes
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] setup-vm.yml [...]
```
:::info
You must do the `setup-vm.yml` step whether you use the logging stack or not
:::

- Update REGARDS using the playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] regards.yml [...]
```

## Breaking change

REGARDS container were booting with a lot of RAM and CPU reservations using the `xmx` and `xms` properties to fix the amount of RAM.

Starting with 1.14, the amount of RAM is now a ratio from the container limit (using `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75`).

It allows you to adapt the quantity of memory allowed by a service inside your inventory.


 | Service            | RAM `version < 1.14` |   RAM  `version >= 1.14` | 
 | -------------      | --------             |   ------------           | 
 | `dam`              | `1920mb`             |  `1280mb`                | 
 | `notifier`         | `1920mb`             |  `1280mb`                | 
 | `fem`              | `1920mb`             |  `1024mb`                | 
 | `catalog`          | `1536mb`             |  `1024mb`                | 
 | `ingest`           | `3840mb`             |  `1536mb`                | 
 | `storage`          | `2560mb`             |  `1024mb`                | 
 | `order`            | `1536mb`             |  `1280mb`                | 
 | `worker_manager`   | `2560mb`             |  `1024mb`                | 

If you want to boot your app without reducing memory, you need to provide a memory limit equivalent to values previously there, like this: 
```yaml

# Stack
group_docker_mservices:
  dam:
    memoryLimit: 1920mb
  notifier:
    memoryLimit: 1920mb
  fem:
    memoryLimit: 1920mb
  catalog:
    memoryLimit: 1536mb
  ingest:
    memoryLimit: 3840mb
  storage:
    memoryLimit: 2560mb
  order:
    memoryLimit: 1536mb
  worker_manager:
    memoryLimit: 2560mb
```

:::info How to tune memory limit?
The new logging stack gives you the amount of memory used by a microservice on live, helping you to fix the right amount of memory limit for your environment.
:::

## Deprecation

- Disabling healthcheck and resource limits will removed on 1.15

```yaml
group_docker_cots_configuration:
  enable_healthcheck: false
  enable_resource_limits: false

group_config_mservices:
  enable_healthcheck: false
  enable_resource_limits: false
```

- The previous logging stack will removed on 1.15

```yaml
group_docker_cots:
  elasticsearch:
    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.cots }}"
  elasticsearch_logs:
    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.cots }}"
  kibana_logs:
    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.cots }}"
    http: 5602
  fluent:
    tag: "{{ group_docker_tags.cots }}"
```

- A good configuration of Docker will be required on 1.15 to specify the logging configuration directly on the Docker daemon side.  
For now, you can still omit the `group_docker_use_log_concentrator` or provide the `false` value to define the configuration on the service.

```yaml
group_docker_use_log_concentrator: false
```
:::info
When `group_docker_use_log_concentrator: True`, it means you have defined a log driver inside `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
    [...]
    # logging stack activated
    "log-driver": "fluentd",
    "log-opts": {
        "fluentd-async": "true",
        "cache-max-size": "10m",
        "cache-max-file": "10",
        "fluentd-retry-wait": "15s",
        "fluentd-address": "127.0.0.1:24224"
    },
    [OR]
    # no logging stack
    "log-driver": "json-file",
    "log-opts": {
        "max-size": "10m",
        "max-file": "10"
    },
    [...]
}
```

On the other hand, inside Docker swarm stack files, there is no need to override the `logging` property to avoid massive disk usage, as this issue is handled directly by the Docker daemon.
```yaml
# A stack file, ie /opt/regards/regards/stack/regards-stack.yml
version: '3.9'
services:
  rs-front:
    [...]
    logging:
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "10"
```
:::

- Property `active_mail_on_admin_instance` will be removed on 1.15

```yaml
group_config_mservices:
  active_mail_on_admin_instance: true
```

- Property `securised` from frontend service will be removed on 1.15

```yaml
group_docker_mservices:
  [...]
  front:
    [...]
    securised: true

```
