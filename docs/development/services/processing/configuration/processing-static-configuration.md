Static configuration is the microservice configuration set before microservice startup in a property file.
This configuration is common to all tenant.

Static configuration for `Processing` service are :

Some other properties can be updated, please check 
[Processing section in the install guide](/docs/setup/swarm/advanced/optimizations#processing-optimization).

:::info
Some of these properties are customizable in ansible inventory. 
[see installation guide](http://localhost:3000/docs/next/setup/swarm/advanced/optimizations)

To make missing properties customizable, you have to update regards ansible playbook : the regards-mconfig role.
