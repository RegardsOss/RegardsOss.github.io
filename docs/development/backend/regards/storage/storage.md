### Retrive AIP files

In order to optimize files access time, REGARDS handle a cache storage system. When a file is asked to be retrieve, if the file is not directly accessible from disk storage [Online Data storages](plugins/data-storage) the file is temporarly copied in cache system. The expiration date of a file in this cache system is configurable in the retrieve access request.
