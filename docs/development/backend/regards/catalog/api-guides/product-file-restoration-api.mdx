_This page assumes you know how [to authenticate](../../../../services/authentication/api-guides/rest/authent-oauth2.mdx) your REST API
requests_

A product stored on REGARDS is either immediately downloadable, or stored on a nearline storage (like AWS Glacier),
requiring the following action to become downloadable.

This guide introduce you **2 endpoints** to make available nearline products in order to download product files
synchronously :

- [Check product availability endpoint](#check-product-availability-endpoint) gives you the status of the file, which indicates if the
  file can be immediately downloaded
- [Product restoration endpoint](#product-restoration-endpoint) makes nearline product files available to download

## Usecase example

Here is an example of product file you need to restore in order be able to download it.  
The product is not a reference (`reference=false`) and not online (`online=false`).

```json title="Some nearline product file - using standard lucene search engine"
{
  "id": "URN:FEATURE:DATA:tenant:50fe35a3-e085-3eb1-bb61-86ab3fdeb7dd:V3",
  "providerId": "DATA-06-20220613-2390",
  "entityType": "DATA",
  ...,
  "files": {
    "RAWDATA": [
      {
        "dataType": "RAWDATA",
        "reference": false,
        "uri": "https://regards.host.com/api/v1/rs-catalog/downloads/URN:FEATURE:DATA:tenant:50fe35a3-e085-3eb1-bb61-86ab3fdeb7dd:V3/files/BF39BC048B52618838529D9D98043190",
        "mimeType": "application/xml",
        "online": false,
        "checksum": "BF39BC048B52618838529D9D98043190",
        "digestAlgorithm": "MD5",
        "filesize": 190,
        "filename": "iso.xml",
        "types": []
      },
      {
        ... 
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

:::info Product URN
The value of the attribute `id` is an URN used to by Check product availability and Product restoration endpoints
:::

## Check product availability endpoint

There is one endpoint for [check availability of single product](../catalog-api-swagger.mdx#tag/file-availability-controller/operation/fileAvailability)
and another endpoint for [check availability of multiple products](../catalog-api-swagger.mdx##tag/file-availability-controller/operation/filesAvailability).
Following example shows response of multiple product endpoint.

This endpoint checks for every file of product(s) if the file is available.

Here is the response format, with an example.

<RegardsApiSchema spec={Spec} pointer="#/components/schemas/FilesAvailabilityResponseDto"/>

```json title="Check availability response: a file to restore"
{
  "products": [
    {
      "files": [
        {
          "available": false,
          "checksum": "BF39BC048B52618838529D9D98043190",
          "expiration_date": "2020-12-31T00:00:00Z"
        }
      ],
      "id": "URN:FEATURE:DATA:tenant:50fe35a3-e085-3eb1-bb61-86ab3fdeb7dd:V3"
    }
  ]
}
```

The attribute `available` value can be:

* `true` - it means product file can be direct downloaded
* `false` - it means product file must be [restored](#3-restore-product) to be downloadable.

A file available can have an `expiration_date`, meaning that file will be not available after this date. It must
be [restored](#3-restore-product) again to be downloadable again.
Expiration date not indicated means REGARDS doesn't know when the file will be unavailable.

:::info
If some product file is missing from the response, it means you don't have access to product file, such product does not
exist
or some internal error occurred.  
In that case, you have to contact REGARDS administrators.
:::

:::danger Number of product limitations
In order to avoid flooding the storage, checking availability is limited to a certain number by API call, [configurable
in catalog microservice configuration](../catalog-api-swagger.mdx#tag/file-availability-controller/operation/filesAvailability).
:::

## Product restoration endpoint

### Endpoint usage

Make product files with `available=false` restored. It has is no effect on file stored in an online storage
or `available=true`.

There is one endpoint for [single product restoration](../catalog-api-swagger.mdx#tag/file-restore-controller/operation/restoreProducts) and
another endpoint for [multiple product restorations](../catalog-api-swagger.mdx#tag/file-restore-controller/operation/restoreProduct).  
These endpoints perform the action asynchronously, so they just return a code `200`.  
Once the restoration is done, a new call to the
endpoint [Check product availability endpoint](#check-product-availability-endpoint) will now mark the file as
available (`available=true`)

:::info
By doing so, restoration ask storage microservice to make available these files.  
After restoration, these files will be available for a configured time in hours.  
Number of hours is configurable in catalog microservice.
:::

:::danger Restored product files remains nearline
After restoration, the product file will still be displayed in the catalog search as offline (`online=false`).  
:::

:::note Note that:
Logged user must have access right to this/these products
:::

### AMQP result

Once the file is restored, you can
be [notified about product restoration using an AMQP message](../../storage/api-guides/file-availability.md#file-available-amqp-message)

This message indicate if the restoration has been done successfully. If so, file is now available and ready to download.
