## Purpose

This starters enables Feign client discovery and use. Feign clients are REST clients used for synchronous HTTP communications between microservices. Requests are automatically load balanced.

## Configuration

Add starter dependency to your POM (version depends on the REGARDS BOM)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>fr.cnes.regards.framework</groupId>
  <artifactId>feign-regards-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Dependency :

* [Multitenant starter](multitenant)
* [GSON starter](gson)
* Security utils to manage Json Web Tokens

```properties
# See multitenant starter properties
# Security utils needs JWT secret
```

## Autoconfiguration

Starter autoconfigures:

* `FeignSecurityManager` to manage security token injection into request headers.
* Enable automatic client discovery in package `fr.cnes.regards` (unless `test` profile is activated)

## How to

### How to create a client

Create a Spring MVC interface annotated with `RestClient` :

```java
@RestClient(name = "targetMicroserviceName")
@RequestMapping(produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE, consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE)
public interface IHelloClient {

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/hello")
    ResponseEntity<Hello> getHello();
}
```

:::danger
When using request or path parameters, you have to explicitly declare expected names (e.g. `@PathVariable("param_name")`)!
:::

:::danger
Produce and consume format has to be set to JSON in `@RequestMapping`.
:::

### How to use a client

Importing Feign starter in your pom.xml, all classes annotated with `RestClient` are automatically discovered in package `fr.cnes.regards`.
So, you can `@Autowired` it in your service.

If client is in a different package, use `@EnableFeignClients` in a configuration class to declare this package.

### How to make a system (i.e. internal) call

By default, `FeignSecurityManager` propagates user token in Feign request from security holder.

To call an endpoint as system, you must inform `FeignSecurityManager` before process request.

If you act as a daemon and you have to manage tenant in **system** client call, use `IRuntimeTenantResolver` to force the right tenant.

```java
try {
  // Optionnaly specify working tenant (thread safe action)
  runtimeTenantResolver.forceTenant("tenant");
  // Enable system call as follow (thread safe action)
  FeignSecurityManager.asSystem();
  // Process client request ...
} finally {
  // We advice you to clean context
  runtimeTenantResolver.clearTenant();
  FeignSecurityManager.reset();
}
```

### How to create a client programmatically

Use `FeignClientBuilder`, `TokenClientProvider` and `FeignSecurityManager` to init one :

```java
MyClient client = FeignClientBuilder.build(new TokenClientProvider<>(MyClient.class,
        "url", feignSecurityManager));
```

### How to mock Feign

Feign starter allows to disable client discovery. To do so, run the tests in a `test` profile (use `@ActiveProfiles`) and mock your clients as you wish (using stub, Mockito, etc.).

If you set your own annotation on a configuration class, we recommend to add profile annotation as follow to be able to mock client in test profile :

```java
@Profile("!test")
@Configuration
@EnableFeignClients("your.package")
```
