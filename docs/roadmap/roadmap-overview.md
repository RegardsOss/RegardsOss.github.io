You will find in the following categories all the release notes corresponding to the different versions of REGARDS. 
These documents describes the high-level features and actions for the REGARDS OSS project in the near to medium-term future.
As with any roadmap, this is a living document that gives you an overview of the works in progress. We aim to update the roadmap with any changes or status updates every year, when we release the next version.
