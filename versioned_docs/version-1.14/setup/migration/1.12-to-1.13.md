Steps to migrate REGARDS from version 1.12 to 1.13

- Shutdown REGARDS using the playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] regards-shutdown.yml [...]
```
- Download last playbook version and move your inventory inside the new playbook
- Edit your inventory file `group_vars/all/main.yml` :
```yaml
# Replace 
  version: 1.12.0
# Into 
  version: 1.13.1
```

:::info
When this guide has been writen, last version was 1.13.1. Check if there is an updated version available [here](https://github.com/orgs/RegardsOss/packages/container/package/rs-authentication)
:::

- Add a property `active_mail_on_admin_instance` inside your inventory file `group_vars/regards_nodes/main.yml`:

```yaml
# Add new property active_mail_on_admin_instance
group_config_mservices:
  enable_healthcheck: true
  enable_resource_limits: true
  active_mail_on_admin_instance: true
  [...]
```

- Also, add a property `security` inside the same file to the frontend service:

 on the front service:
```yaml
group_docker_mservices:
  [...]
  front:
    [...]
    securised: true
```

- Install REGARDS using the playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i [...] regards.yml [...]
```
